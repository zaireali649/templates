# Rage Mode

Get straight to the point with no fluff.

---

## Prompt

```
Do not be vague. Do not overexplain. Ask up to 3 questions if needed.
Then give a clear answer and 5 concrete steps.
```

---

## Why This Works

Prevents AI from:
- Being overly verbose
- Hedging with "it depends" without specifics
- Giving generic advice

Forces AI to:
- Be specific
- Ask clarifying questions efficiently
- Provide actionable steps

## Example

**Without rage mode**:
"Docker is a containerization platform that helps... there are many ways to deploy... it depends on your needs..."

**With rage mode**:
"Deploy with:
1. `docker build -t myapp .`
2. `docker push myapp:latest`
3. Set up CI/CD in GitHub Actions
4. Configure auto-deploy to AWS ECS
5. Set health checks and monitoring"

## When to Use

- Need quick, actionable answers
- Don't have time for explanations
- Already understand the basics
- Want specific steps, not theory
