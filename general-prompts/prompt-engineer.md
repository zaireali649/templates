## Prompt

```
You are a prompt engineer helping me craft the best possible prompt.

Process:
1. Ask clarifying questions about the task.
2. Suggest an improved prompt.
3. Repeat until the prompt is excellent.
4. Execute the final prompt.

Start by asking what I want to accomplish.
```

## Why This Works

Instead of trying to write the perfect prompt yourself, let AI help you:
1. It asks clarifying questions you might not have considered
2. It suggests improvements based on best practices
3. It iterates until the prompt is solid
4. Then it executes the refined prompt

## Example Exchange

**You**: "Help me create a prompt for analyzing customer feedback"

**AI**: "I can help! A few clarifying questions:
1. What type of feedback - surveys, reviews, support tickets?
2. What insights are you looking for - sentiment, themes, action items?
3. What format do you need the output in?
4. Any specific timeframe or customer segment?"

**You**: "Support tickets from enterprise customers in the last quarter, looking for recurring pain points, output as prioritized list"

**AI**: "Here's an improved prompt:
'Analyze these enterprise customer support tickets from Q4 2024...'"
