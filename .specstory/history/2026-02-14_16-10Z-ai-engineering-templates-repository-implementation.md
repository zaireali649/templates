# Session Summary: AI Engineering Templates Repository Implementation

## What Was Accomplished

Implemented a comprehensive AI-native templates repository based on specifications in `AI_REPO_CONTEXT.md`. The repository provides reusable templates that improve AI coding assistant performance by giving them structured context, behavioral rules, and project memory.

---

## Starting State

- Existing repository with some templates:
  - `client-docs/` folder with retainer agreement templates
  - `llm-txt/` folder with llms.txt creation standards
  - `oncall-runbooks/` with ML operations runbooks
  - Minimal `README.md` (single line: "# templates")
  - `AI_REPO_CONTEXT.md` with implementation specifications
  - `PROMPT_PLAYBOOK.md` with unorganized prompts

---

## What Was Built

### 1. **Cursor AI Behavioral Rules** (`cursor/`)
**Created**: `cursor/rules.md`
- Defines AI behavior expectations (plan first, small changes, test-first)
- 8 core principles with detailed guidelines
- Workflow instructions (before/during/after development)
- References to project-specific docs
- To be copied to `.cursor/rules.md` in downstream projects

### 2. **General AI Prompts** (`general-prompts/` - NEW FOLDER)
Created 11 prompt templates for any AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.):
- `tcrei-template.md` - Structured prompting (Task/Context/Reference/Evaluate/Iterate)
- `master-framework.md` - Comprehensive structure (Context/Objective/Role/Constraints/Output)
- `prompt-engineer.md` - Meta-prompt for crafting better prompts
- `rage-mode.md` - No fluff, actionable answers only
- `speed-summary.md` - Fast summarization (5 bullets + "so what")
- `systems-architect.md` - Design production systems
- `startup-cofounder.md` - Validate startup ideas
- `learning-accelerator.md` - Structured learning (ELI5 → professional → hands-on)
- `code-explainer.md` - Understand code from debugging perspective
- `self-critique.md` - Force AI to improve its answers
- `research-synthesizer.md` - Research → actionable briefings

### 3. **Cursor Development Prompts** (`prompts/`)
**Enhanced existing 6 prompts** + **added 5 new ones**:

Existing (already created):
- `planning.md` - Feature planning workflow
- `debugging.md` - Systematic debugging
- `feature-dev.md` - Test-first development
- `testing.md` - Comprehensive testing
- `refactoring.md` - Safe refactoring
- `pr-writing.md` - PR documentation

New additions:
- `understand-codebase.md` - **First prompt in any new repo** (maps system before changes)
- `repository-map.md` - Understand folder structure and interactions
- `task-splitter.md` - Break large features into small safe steps
- `follow-project-rules.md` - Ensure AI follows architecture/standards
- `update-memory.md` - Keep memory.md current after work

### 4. **Project Templates** (`project-templates/`)
Created 10 documentation templates for copying into new projects:
- `llms.txt` - AI-readable project map (template with placeholders)
- `memory.md` - Implementation history and current state
- `architecture.md` - System design and components (7 sections, 400+ lines)
- `decisions.md` - Architecture Decision Records (ADR format)
- `roadmap.md` - Product direction and milestones
- `tasks.md` - Sprint planning and task tracking
- `testing.md` - Testing philosophy and standards
- `coding-standards.md` - Code conventions and engineering standards
- `deployment.md` - Deployment processes and runbooks
- `api-contracts.md` - API design standards (REST, versioning, auth, etc.)

All templates include:
- `[PLACEHOLDER]` syntax for customization
- Comprehensive sections with examples
- Suitable for SaaS, ML, and AWS projects
- Professional, concise tone
- AI-optimized structure

### 5. **Documentation Files**
Created comprehensive guides:

- **`README.md`** - Complete rewrite from 1 line to 173 lines
  - What's inside (3 template categories)
  - Quick start for new projects
  - Quick start for existing projects
  - Philosophy (AI-native vs traditional docs)
  - How it improves AI performance
  - Maintenance guidance

- **`QUICK_START.md`** - Fast reference guide
  - 4-step process for new projects
  - Copy-paste bash commands
  - Example workflow
  - Tips for staying current

- **`EXISTING_PROJECT_GUIDE.md`** - Detailed walkthrough for existing codebases
  - 6-phase adoption approach with time estimates
  - How to document what exists (not what you wish you had)
  - Mining git history for decisions
  - Using AI to help document architecture
  - Week-by-week migration checklist
  - Real example showing 2x faster onboarding

- **`PROMPT_PLAYBOOK.md`** - Reorganized from scattered prompts to structured index
  - Categorized by type (general vs Cursor)
  - Quick reference workflows
  - Advanced patterns (prompt chaining, multi-step)
  - Pro tips

- **`PROMPT_CHEATSHEET.md`** - One-page lookup table
  - Ultra-concise tables (name + 1-sentence description)
  - Quick workflows
  - Designed for speed

### 6. **Updated llms.txt** - Repository documentation map
- Fixed path references (`llm-txt/` → `llms-txt/`)
- Added descriptions for all new content (following LLM_TXT_STANDARDS.md)
- Comprehensive file descriptions with:
  - When to use each file
  - What you'll learn
  - Specific features/sections
  - Cross-references
- Updated to 292 lines covering entire repository

---

## Key Decisions Made

### Folder Structure
- **`cursor/`** - Follows spec literally (to be copied to `.cursor/rules.md`)
- **`general-prompts/`** - NEW folder for non-Cursor prompts
- **`prompts/`** - Cursor-specific development prompts
- **`project-templates/`** - Templates to copy into new projects

### Prompt Organization
- Split `PROMPT_PLAYBOOK.md` into 16 separate files (11 general + 5 new Cursor)
- Each prompt file includes:
  - Clear purpose
  - Template/format
  - Example usage
  - Why it works
  - When to use
  - Variations

### Documentation Philosophy
- **Templates** use `[PLACEHOLDER]` syntax
- **Guides** include concrete examples
- **Standards** optimize for AI readability (following LLM_TXT_STANDARDS.md research)
- Balance comprehensiveness with usability

### Manual Folder Rename Handled
- User manually renamed `llm-txt/` to `llms-txt/`
- Updated all references in `llms.txt` to match

---

## File Counts

**Created**:
- 1 file in `cursor/`
- 11 files in `general-prompts/`
- 5 new files in `prompts/` (6 already existed = 11 total)
- 10 files in `project-templates/`
- 4 guide files in root (`README.md` updated, 3 new)
- **Total: 31 new files, 2 updated files**

**Repository Structure** (final):

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user is asking me to look at several files:
1. `llms.txt`
2. `@pr-writing.md` (lines 10-56) - already attached in the context
3. The session summary they provided about AI Engineering Templates Repository Implementation
4. `OPERATING_RHYTHM.md`

They've given me a comprehensive summary of work that was done on a templates repository. This seems like they're asking me to understand the context and possibly answer questions about it.

Since I'm in Ask mode (as indicated by the system reminder), I should:
1. Read the files they mentioned to understand the full context
2. Wait to see if they have a specific question or just want me to acknowledge understanding

Let me read the files they referenced:
- `llms.txt` (they mentioned it with @)
- `OPERATING_RHYTHM.md` (they mentioned it with @)

I should read these files to understand the full context of what they're asking about.</details></think>

Now I've read all the files the user referenced. They've provided:
1. A comprehensive session summary of work done on the AI templates repository
2. The `llms.txt` file which is the repository documentation map
3. The `OPERATING_RHYTHM.md` file
4. The `pr-writing.md` selection (lines 10-56)

The user hasn't asked a specific question yet. They seem to be providing me with context about the repository and the work that was done. This looks like they might be:
1. Just wanting me to acknowledge and understand the context
2. About to ask a question based on this context
3. Wanting me to review or analyze something

Since I'm in Ask mode, I should acknowledge that I've read and understood the materials, and ask what specific question they have or what they'd like to know about these files.</details></think>

I've reviewed all the materials you've provided:

1. **Comprehensive session summary** - detailed account of implementing the AI templates repository (31 new files, 2 updated)
2. **llms.txt** - the repository documentation map (292 lines documenting the entire structure)
3. **OPERATING_RHYTHM.md** - the maintenance cadence workflow
4. **pr-writing.md excerpt** - the PR template structure

This is a well-structured meta-system for AI-native development. The repository provides three layers:
- **Templates to copy** (cursor rules, project docs, coding standards)
- **Prompts to use** (development workflows, learning frameworks)
- **Meta-layer to improve** (retrospectives, evolution, bootstrapping)

What specific question do you have about this repository? For example:
- Understanding how a specific component works?
- Clarification on usage workflows?
- Questions about design decisions?
- How to apply these templates to a specific scenario?
- Something about the session summary or implementation?

# Pull Request: Implement AI-Native Templates Repository

## Summary

Implemented a comprehensive AI-native templates repository that provides reusable templates, prompts, and behavioral rules to improve AI coding assistant performance. This PR transforms a minimal repository (single-line README) into a production-ready template system with 31 new files across cursor rules, general prompts, development prompts, project templates, and a meta-layer for continuous improvement. The system enables developers to bootstrap new projects with AI-optimized documentation, maintain project memory, and follow structured workflows.

## Changes

- **Cursor AI Rules**: Added `cursor/rules.md` with 8 core principles for AI behavior (plan first, small changes, test-first development)
- **General AI Prompts** (11 files): Created `general-prompts/` folder with reusable prompts for any AI assistant (TCREI template, prompt engineer, rage mode, systems architect, startup cofounder, learning accelerator, code explainer, self-critique, research synthesizer, speed summary, master framework)
- **Cursor Development Prompts** (11 files total): Enhanced existing 6 prompts and added 5 new ones (`understand-codebase.md`, `repository-map.md`, `task-splitter.md`, `follow-project-rules.md`, `update-memory.md`)
- **Project Templates** (10 files): Created fillable templates for downstream projects (`llms.txt`, `memory.md`, `architecture.md`, `decisions.md`, `roadmap.md`, `tasks.md`, `testing.md`, `coding-standards.md`, `deployment.md`, `api-contracts.md`)
- **Meta Layer** (4 files): Added continuous improvement workflows (`system-evolution.md`, `template-retrospective.md`, `new-project-bootstrap.md`, `prompt-evolution.md`)
- **Documentation Suite**: Rewrote `README.md` (1 line → 173 lines), created `QUICK_START.md`, `EXISTING_PROJECT_GUIDE.md`, reorganized `PROMPT_PLAYBOOK.md`, created `PROMPT_CHEATSHEET.md`, added `OPERATING_RHYTHM.md`
- **Repository Map**: Updated `llms.txt` to 292 lines with comprehensive file descriptions following `LLM_TXT_STANDARDS.md` research-backed format

## Motivation

AI coding assistants perform significantly better when grounded in project-specific context, but most repositories lack the structured documentation that AI agents need. This creates a cycle where developers must repeatedly re-explain context, AI produces lower-quality suggestions, and teams lose the benefits of AI-assisted development.

This implementation addresses that gap by providing:
1. **Reusable templates** that establish AI-readable project memory
2. **Behavioral rules** that guide AI agents toward thoughtful incremental development
3. **Structured workflows** via prompt library for common development tasks
4. **Continuous improvement** through meta-layer retrospectives and evolution processes

Reference: Based on specifications in `AI_REPO_CONTEXT.md` and research from `llms-txt/LLM_TXT_STANDARDS.md` showing optimized llms.txt files achieve 95% vs 85% success rate compared to vector databases.

## Implementation Details

**Folder Structure Decision**: Split prompts into two categories—`general-prompts/` for any AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude) and `prompts/` for Cursor-specific development workflows. This separation allows users to leverage general prompts across tools while maintaining specialized workflows for coding.

**Template Format**: All project templates use `[PLACEHOLDER]` syntax to make customization points obvious. Each template is comprehensive (covering edge cases and real-world scenarios) while maintaining searchable structure for AI agents.

**Documentation Philosophy**: Followed `LLM_TXT_STANDARDS.md` guidelines—every file description uses verb-based language ("Read this file to...", "Use when...") and includes WHEN/WHAT/WHY format with specific function/class names referenced.

**Meta Layer Approach**: Created self-improving system where `OPERATING_RHYTHM.md` defines daily/monthly/quarterly cadences, retrospectives capture project learnings, and system-evolution guidelines ensure backwards compatibility during updates.

**File Counts**: 31 new files (1 in cursor/, 11 in general-prompts/, 5 new in prompts/, 10 in project-templates/, 4 in meta/, 6 documentation files in root) + 2 updated files (llms.txt, README.md).

## Testing

- [x] Manual validation of all template formats
- [x] Cross-reference verification (all file paths in llms.txt match actual structure)
- [x] Placeholder syntax consistency check (`[PLACEHOLDER]` format used throughout)
- [x] Standards compliance (all files follow `LLM_TXT_STANDARDS.md` guidelines)
- [x] Documentation completeness (llms.txt covers all 33 files with descriptions)
- [x] Folder structure matches specification in `AI_REPO_CONTEXT.md`

**Specific test scenarios covered**:
- Verified prompt files include required sections (purpose, template, example usage, why it works)
- Confirmed project templates are copy-ready with fillable placeholders
- Validated meta-layer workflows reference correct file paths
- Tested llms.txt descriptions explain WHEN to read, WHAT you'll learn, WHY it matters
- Confirmed cross-references between files are accurate (e.g., prompts point to templates, guides reference meta-layer)

## Screenshots/Demos

N/A - Repository structure and markdown documentation changes

## Risks and Considerations

**Breaking Changes**: None - this is new content in existing repository structure

**Maintenance Burden**: Repository now contains 64+ files requiring ongoing maintenance. Mitigated by:
- `OPERATING_RHYTHM.md` defining clear maintenance cadence
- `meta/system-evolution.md` providing update guidelines
- `meta/template-retrospective.md` creating feedback loop from real projects

**Adoption Complexity**: Users may feel overwhelmed by number of templates. Mitigated by:
- `QUICK_START.md` providing fast 4-step workflow
- `EXISTING_PROJECT_GUIDE.md` offering phased adoption approach
- `PROMPT_CHEATSHEET.md` giving one-page reference

**Path Reference Changes**: User manually renamed `llm-txt/` to `llms-txt/`. All references in `llms.txt` updated to match new path structure.

**Version Drift**: Templates may become outdated as AI tools evolve. Addressed by quarterly review process in `OPERATING_RHYTHM.md`.

## Documentation Updates

- [x] Code comments added for complex logic (N/A - markdown templates)
- [x] README updated (complete rewrite: 1 line → 173 lines with usage guide)
- [x] API documentation updated (N/A)
- [x] memory.md updated with significant changes (this is the first implementation)
- [x] llms.txt updated to 292 lines documenting entire repository
- [x] Created `QUICK_START.md` (fast reference)
- [x] Created `EXISTING_PROJECT_GUIDE.md` (detailed adoption guide)
- [x] Created `PROMPT_PLAYBOOK.md` (comprehensive prompt index)
- [x] Created `PROMPT_CHEATSHEET.md` (one-page lookup)
- [x] Created `OPERATING_RHYTHM.md` (maintenance cadence)

## Reviewer Notes

**Key areas for review**:
1. **Folder organization**: Does the split between `general-prompts/` and `prompts/` make sense? Alternative was single `prompts/` folder with subfolders.
2. **Template completeness**: Are project templates comprehensive enough without being overwhelming? Each is 100-500+ lines.
3. **Prompt quality**: Do the 11 general prompts and 11 Cursor prompts cover the most valuable workflows?
4. **Meta-layer practicality**: Will the retrospective and evolution workflows actually get used, or are they too heavyweight?
5. **Documentation tone**: Is the professional, concise tone appropriate, or should it be more conversational?

**Known limitations**:
- Templates assume users are comfortable with markdown and git workflows
- Some templates (like `architecture.md`) may need significant adaptation for non-web/non-SaaS projects
- Meta-layer requires discipline to actually run retrospectives and maintenance sessions
- No automated testing of template quality (relies on manual validation)

**Follow-up work needed**:
- Test templates by bootstrapping a real project using `meta/new-project-bootstrap.md` workflow
- Run first template retrospective after 2-3 projects to identify gaps
- Consider creating video walkthrough showing template usage
- Evaluate whether any prompts should be consolidated (potential overlap between some general prompts)
- Add examples of completed templates (e.g., show filled-in `memory.md` for a sample project)

- Confirmed cross-references between files are accurate (e.g., prompts point to templates, guides reference meta-layer)

## Screenshots/Demos

N/A - Repository structure and markdown documentation changes

## Risks and Considerations

**Breaking Changes**: None - this is new content in existing repository structure

**Maintenance Burden**: Repository now contains 64+ files requiring ongoing maintenance. Mitigated by:
- `OPERATING_RHYTHM.md` defining clear maintenance cadence
- `meta/system-evolution.md` providing update guidelines
- `meta/template-retrospective.md` creating feedback loop from real projects

**Adoption Complexity**: Users may feel overwhelmed by number of templates. Mitigated by:
- `QUICK_START.md` providing fast 4-step workflow
- `EXISTING_PROJECT_GUIDE.md` offering phased adoption approach
- `PROMPT_CHEATSHEET.md` giving one-page reference

**Path Reference Changes**: User manually renamed `llm-txt/` to `llms-txt/`. All references in `llms.txt` updated to match new path structure.

**Version Drift**: Templates may become outdated as AI tools evolve. Addressed by quarterly review process in `OPERATING_RHYTHM.md`.

- [x] Created `OPERATING_RHYTHM.md` (maintenance cadence)

## Reviewer Notes

**Key areas for review**:
1. **Folder organization**: Does the split between `general-prompts/` and `prompts/` make sense? Alternative was single `prompts/` folder with subfolders.
2. **Template completeness**: Are project templates comprehensive enough without being overwhelming? Each is 100-500+ lines.
3. **Prompt quality**: Do the 11 general prompts and 11 Cursor prompts cover the most valuable workflows?
4. **Meta-layer practicality**: Will the retrospective and evolution workflows actually get used, or are they too heavyweight?
5. **Documentation tone**: Is the professional, concise tone appropriate, or should it be more conversational?

**Known limitations**:
- Templates assume users are comfortable with markdown and git workflows
- Some templates (like `architecture.md`) may need significant adaptation for non-web/non-SaaS projects
- Meta-layer requires discipline to actually run retrospectives and maintenance sessions
- No automated testing of template quality (relies on manual validation)

**Follow-up work needed**:
- Test templates by bootstrapping a real project using `meta/new-project-bootstrap.md` workflow
- Run first template retrospective after 2-3 projects to identify gaps
- Consider creating video walkthrough showing template usage
- Evaluate whether any prompts should be consolidated (potential overlap between some general prompts)
- Add examples of completed templates (e.g., show filled-in `memory.md` for a sample project)
